# Specs

Central repository containing all of my specs

## Why do are you keeping all your specs in one place?

I wanted my specs to be published on [turnipxenon.com](https://turnipxenon.com/), and I think the most convenient way to do this is by centralizing them all over here. I also read this StackOverflow question which inspired me to put them in one place instead of separate places: [Where should functional specs be stored and how should their revision history be tracked?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1966002/where-should-functional-specs-be-stored-and-how-should-their-revision-history-be). I initially have them in their repositories. In the future I want them to exist here, and published for easier consumption at turnipxenon.com.
